The code is ment to take two list extract strip the second value in the in both lists
and combine them to create a curve.
I use the the script to combine the Displacemnet and the Reaction Force.

The u is displacement and the rf is the reaction force.

The purpose for this script is that instead of opening the program and saving the file I hope to be
able to exicute the script and have the bulk of the work done.

This is just a step for what I want to do .
